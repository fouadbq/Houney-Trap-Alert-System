# Houney-Trap-Alert-System


## Description
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program is designed to detect unauthorized access and data breaches by creating a honey trap file disguised as a text file. When the file is opened, it triggers a program that first encrypts the data and then retrieves the coordinates of the machine, including the country, city, and current IP address. The program then sends this information to the email provided by the client during the initialization phase.

In addition to this functionality, the program also contains another program that allows the user to recover the encrypted data using the decryption key that it receives along with the machine coordinates. This ensures that the encrypted data can be accessed and recovered by authorized users only.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program uses advanced encryption algorithms to secure the data and protect it from unauthorized access. It also utilizes advanced techniques to detect and prevent hacking attempts and unauthorized access. The program is user-friendly and easy to use, with clear instructions and step-by-step guides for encrypting and decrypting data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the program provides a comprehensive solution for detecting and preventing unauthorized access and data breaches, while also ensuring that authorized users can access and recover encrypted data as needed. It is an essential tool for anyone who wants to protect their sensitive information and ensure that it remains secure at all times.
