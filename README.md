# Houney-Trap-Alert-System


## Description
<br/>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This tool is meant to detect unwanted access and data breaches by creating a honey trap file disguised as a text file labeled "My passwords" that would deceive the attacker into opening the honey trap file, believing that it contains valuable credentials. When the file is opened, it triggers a program that encrypts the data and retrieves the machine's coordinates, including the country, city, and current IP address. The program then sends this information to the client's email address, which was provided during the startup process.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In addition to this feature, the program also includes another program that allows authorized users to recover the encrypted data using the decryption key that is transmitted along with the machine's coordinates. This ensures that only authorized users can access and recover the encrypted data.

This program shall be automatically deleted after fulfilling the required information, and a hidden file where this information is stored is created.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  >Next create a folder Name it for instance 'My passwords' in some location of your choice.<br/>
